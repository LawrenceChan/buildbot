  * don't retire a missing-notification-timer until you finish accepting a slave
  Previously, we retired the timer when we began accepting the slave.  However, if we then detected duplicate connection and rejected one of the connections, then the resulting detach would start a new missing-notification-timer.  With this patch, the missing-notification-timer that is started by detaching a connection is soon retired by the other connection leading to acceptance of the buildslave.  So this probably fixes the other way that issue #211 was happening (after the previous patch that was intended to fix #211).

Tue Apr 15 13:20:22 PDT 2008  zooko@zooko.com
  * don't create a new missing-timer task if there is already one there
  Doing that would mean that the one that is already there will not be cleaned up if the buildslave reattaches before the timer goes off, so this patch probably fixed #211.

  * move old ChangeLog to ChangeLog-0.7.8

	* ChangeLog-0.7.8: rename old ChangeLog. We're going to try a new
	scheme: use GNU-style ChangeLog entries, stored in the darcs
	commit comments (i.e. in the extended patch name). The first few
	lines of the comment can be the usual descriptive thing, but the
	trailing part of the comments should be the ChangeLog entry. At
	release time, we'll dump all of these into a new ChangeLog-NNN for
	the new release. There will be no "ChangeLog" file in the source
	tree. I'm not sure how well this will work, but we'll give it a
	try.
