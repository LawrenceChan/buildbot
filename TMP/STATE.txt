The current state of Buildbot-1.0
---------------------------------

== Prerequisites ==

Since Python-2.6 and Python-3.0 are now available, Buildbot-1.0 requires at
least Python-2.5.  This allows the use of microthreading, described below
(uthreads).

== General Layout ==

The Buildbot distribution is divided into two major components: the buildbot
framework, which manages the configuration file, network communications, and
providing connections for all of the various pieces of a build process; and a
collection of resources that actually do interesting things.  The framework is
contained in the buildbot.framework package, and its objects implement with
the interfaces in buildbot.framework.interfaces.  Resources are available in
buildbot.resources, separated by type (e.g., buildbot.resources.schedulers).

Note that lots of code from Buildbot-0.* remains in the repository.  This will
not be removed until it is necessary, as much of it will be useful in
Buildbot-1.0.

== buildbot.config ==

All symbols that might be useful in a configuration file are imported into
buildbot.config, and this module's symbols are then made available to the
Python code in the config file, eliminating the need to import symbols in the
configuration file.

== buildbot.buildmaster ==

There is only one buildmaster in a twistd process, and it is available at
buildbot.buildmaster.

== Config Reloading and ServicePools ==

Effective reloading of configuration files is supported through ServicePools.
Most top-level Buildbot objects are implemented as PoolMembers, and can be
updgraded or replaced smoothly when the configuration is reloaded.

== Subscriptions ==

Objects in Buildbot often have a need to be notified of changes in another
object.  Buidlbot.framework.subscriptions implements a simple subscription
system to avoid repeatedly implementing this simple pattern.

== SourceManagers ==

The beginnings of support for handling source code are in place.  A
SourceManager is responsible for dealing with source code: monitoring for
changes in a respository, producing and interpreting opaque SourceStamps
(which represent a particular copy of the source code), and providing
functions to check out source on slaves.

SourceManagers can also perform more advanced operations on SourceStamps, such
as calculating the "previous" SourceStamp or listing changes or creating a
blamelist between two SourceStamps.

== Microthreading ==

Microthreads, implemented by the buildbot.uthreads package, provide a way to
write natural-looking python functions that execute in the Twisted
(asynchronous) environment.  For documentation, see

  http://code.google.com/p/uthreads/source/browse/trunk/doc/python-microthreading.txt

== Schedulers ==

Schedulers interface with SourceManagers to initiate builds.  See "Build
Process", below, for details on the build functions.

== History ==

The history of builds within a buildmaster is stored in a hierarchy of
IHistoryElt objects, which are created naturally as a build progresses.

== Build Process ==

Builds are executed as Python functions, which means that they have a lot more
flexibility in their structure than Buildbot-0.x builds.  A build can be as
simple as a single function which executes a few steps in sequence, but can
also employ conditionals and loops, produce nested steps and other builds, run
several actions in parallel, and more.  The distinction between builds and
steps is largely left to the user, but in general a build operates on a single
machine and produces an overall result that the user will be interested in,
while a step is a smaller action that is coordinated with other steps to
produce a build.

Functions which are to be used in a build are all microthreaded, and all take
an IContext object as their first argument.  This object encapsulates the
context of the particular build process.

buildbot.framework.process defines some decorators that are useful to indicate
that execution of a particular build function represents a new build or a new
step.
